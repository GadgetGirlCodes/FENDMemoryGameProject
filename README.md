## Goal

To create an interactive web-based memory game that tracks time, moves, and rating based on amount of moves. Complete with congratulatory pop-up upon completion, as well as a reset function.

## How to Play

Access the interactive game here: https://gadgetgirlcodes.github.io/FENDMemoryGameProject/

Click each card to flip over the card. Based on memory, attempt to match all pairs of cards.

A reset button is located at the top right of the board for starting over.
